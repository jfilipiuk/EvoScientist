# Release checks shared by the workflows. Run from the repository root.
#
#   release  (publish.yml, docker.yml) The ref is a version tag, the
#            pyproject.toml version matches it, uv.lock is up to date and
#            constraints.txt matches its export. A release that fails any of
#            these is published neither to PyPI nor as versioned images.
#   pr       (release-check.yml) The uv.lock and constraints.txt checks, only
#            when the pull request changes the pyproject.toml version, so a
#            release PR is fixed before its tag exists. BASE_SHA is the pull
#            request's base commit; the checkout has only the merge commit, so
#            it is fetched here.
