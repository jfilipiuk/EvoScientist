"""ErrorNormalizationMiddleware — catch provider-SDK exceptions at the
model boundary and re-raise as a normalized non-dataclass wrapper.

Some provider SDKs (openrouter.errors.* today) decorate their exception
classes with ``@dataclass``. When langgraph_api emits an SSE error
frame via ``json_dumpb`` → ``orjson.dumps(obj, default=default,
option=OPT_SERIALIZE_DATACLASS)``, orjson's dataclass fast-path
enumerates the fields directly and skips the ``default=`` hook that
builds our envelope. The wire payload comes out as
``{"message": …, "status_code": …, "body": …, "headers": null,
"raw_response": null, "data": {…}}`` with no ``error`` / ``class`` /
``provider`` envelope and no way for the WebUI to distinguish quota /
auth / rate-limit / model-not-found.

This middleware sits at the model-call boundary. It catches
``BaseException`` from ``handler()``, and if ``request.model`` is a
recognized provider SDK client, wraps the exception in a
:class:`~EvoScientist.llm.errors.ProviderStreamError` (a plain
``Exception`` subclass, not a dataclass). The wrapper carries the SSE
envelope pre-baked on its instance attributes.

Contract: the wrap decision is based on the **model**, not the
exception. Every exception raised inside a call to a recognized
provider model gets wrapped — SDK exceptions, httpx errors,
langchain-wrapper failures, and even builtins like ``RuntimeError``.
At the middleware boundary we can tell which provider was in use, but
not the exception's precise origin; a uniform envelope is more useful
to the WebUI than gambling on the exception class. If the model isn't
from a recognized provider, or the request carries no ``.model``, the
exception re-raises unchanged and upstream's whitelist / catch-all
behavior takes over.
