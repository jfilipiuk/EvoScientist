"""Deployed graph entry for the main EvoScientist agent.

The main ``EvoScientist_agent`` is exposed via ``__getattr__`` lazy loading
in ``EvoScientist/EvoScientist.py`` so it doesn't construct on plain
``import EvoScientist``. ``langgraph dev`` 's symbol resolver inspects
module attributes directly and doesn't trigger ``__getattr__``, so we
re-export here to make it visible.

Before re-export we upgrade the compiled graph's class in place to
``_EvoFilteredGraph``, which strips ``PrivateStateAttr``-marked fields
(currently just ``_quickjs_snapshot_payload``) from ``get_state`` /
``get_state_history`` responses. Upstream ``langchain_quickjs`` annotates
the field ``PrivateStateAttr = OmitFromSchema(input=True, output=True)``,
but LangGraph's ``_prepare_state_snapshot`` doesn't honor that on
checkpoint reads — every ``getState`` materializes the delta chain back
into a full ~1.4 MB blob, which the WebUI then downloads. The subclass
closes the gap without touching the middleware's write path, preserving
cross-turn REPL persistence as ``langchain-ai/deepagents#3064`` shipped it.

    """Strip ``PrivateStateAttr``-marked fields from a ``StateSnapshot``.

    Verified against a live history response (`019f1cf3-...` thread, 1 touched
    turn), the private field leaks on four surfaces — three trivial, one heavy:

    * ``snap.values`` — the materialized channel state exposed as the main
      payload. For DeltaChannels this is the delta chain replayed into full
      bytes (~1.4 MB for the quickjs snapshot). ``get_state`` and every
      history entry.
    * ``snap.metadata['writes']`` — ``{node_name: {channel: value}}`` map of
      the raw writes that produced each checkpoint. On the ``after_agent``
      step that first snapshots the REPL, ``value`` is the encoded write
      record ``("snap", full_bytes)`` ≈ 1.4 MB.
    * ``snap.tasks[*].result`` — the return dict of each completed
      ``PregelTask``. ``after_agent`` returns
      ``{"_quickjs_snapshot_payload": ("snap", bytes)}``; this dict becomes
      the task's ``result`` field, which the API surfaces verbatim under
      ``tasks[*].result`` (``langgraph_api.state:106``). This is the
      dominant leak: 1.7 MB in the last history entry of any thread whose
      most-recent-in-window checkpoint had a snapshot anchor.
    * ``snap.metadata['counters_since_delta_snapshot']`` — DeltaChannel's
      snapshot cadence bookkeeping ``{channel: [count, superstep]}``. Tiny
      (~20 B) but exposes the private field name; strip for cleanliness.
