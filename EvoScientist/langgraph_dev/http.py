"""Custom HTTP routes mounted alongside the langgraph dev server.

The langgraph-api host supports a top-level ``http`` key in
``langgraph.json`` that names an ASGI app to mount on the same
process as the graph. We use it to surface the registry the WebUI's
``/model`` picker needs.

Why this lives here and not as a separate sidecar: the WebUI talks to
``EvoSci deploy``'s langgraph endpoint anyway, so one origin keeps the
WebUI's fetch logic simple — no CORS dance, no extra port to configure.

Why Starlette and not FastAPI: ``langgraph_api`` already depends on
Starlette; adding FastAPI would pull in pydantic v1-vs-v2 reconciliation
the deploy doesn't need. The one route here has no input model, just a
JSON body, so the lower-level surface is sufficient.

Lightweight by design — module-level imports stick to ``config``,
``llm.models`` (registry only; no chat-model construction), and
Starlette itself. Nothing on this surface should pull the agent into
memory.

    """Return the model registry as ``{entries, default}``.

    ``entries`` preserves the registry order so the WebUI picker can
    rank providers per short name the same way the backend would.
    Mirrors the TUI ``/model`` picker by appending locally-pulled
    Ollama models when ``ollama_base_url`` is configured — same
    ``discover_ollama_models()`` call, same 1.5-s timeout, same
    fail-soft semantics (the probe returns ``[]`` on any error, never
    raises). The TUI's "Custom Ollama model…" sentinel is intentionally
    omitted — that's a widget-specific input affordance, not part of
    the registry surface.

    ``default`` reflects the deployment's currently-configured fallback
    (``config.yaml``'s ``model`` / ``provider`` — what ``/model reset``
    would land on). Returned even when the configured pair isn't in
    the registry, so the picker can still label it.

    Uses ``get_effective_config()`` (not ``load_config()``) so env-var
    overrides like ``OLLAMA_BASE_URL`` from ``_ENV_MAPPINGS`` are
    honored — matching the deploy's actual model-building behavior.
    Offloaded to a thread because ``get_effective_config()`` calls
    ``find_dotenv(usecwd=True)`` which invokes ``os.getcwd()`` — a
    blocking syscall that langgraph-dev's ``blockbuster`` middleware
    refuses to allow on the async event loop (would surface as a 500).

    A "team" in the WebUI vocabulary is an installed expert skill —
    ``SKILL.md`` with ``type: expert`` frontmatter. The response is a
    curated, gallery-safe projection: name + description, plus optional
    ``byline`` / ``capability_tags`` / ``avatar_hint`` when the skill
    populates them.

    Backend implementation details (SKILL.md body / system prompt, role
    line, default_dispatch, tool list, source tier, filesystem path,
    tags) are intentionally NOT projected. The gallery only needs
    identity + descriptor fields to render the card; anything richer
    belongs in a dedicated info endpoint.

    Sourced from ``list_expert_skills(include_system=True)`` so
    first-party experts shipped as builtin skills surface alongside
    workspace/global installs.

    Offloaded to a thread because the skill loader does synchronous
    filesystem walking + yaml parsing, which langgraph-dev's
    ``blockbuster`` middleware refuses on the async event loop.
