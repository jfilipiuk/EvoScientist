"""Expert-subagent-spec factory for the v1 agent-teams feature.

Turns an installed **expert skill** (a `SkillInfo` with `type == "expert"`) into
a deepagents subagent spec dict compatible with `subagents=[...]` on
`create_deep_agent`. The main agent's `_build_base_kwargs` folds these specs
into its subagent list at construction time so the `task` tool can dispatch to
each installed expert for sync consult; the same registry is reused by the
QuickJS `task()` global for panel mode.

The generic-container principle from #361 lives in THIS FUNCTION — one
construction path for all experts, sourcing behaviour from the skill file
rather than a per-expert YAML. There's no deployed graph per expert in v1;
that's async-thread territory (v2) and blocked on the deepagents
`AsyncSubAgent` config-passthrough gap.
